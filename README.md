# Lake-Purification-System
## Introduction
A project created in 2 days, which can be extended to a large-scale operation.
The creation of an Arduino-based open-source water testing platform marks a notable advancement in water quality monitoring technology. This system, utilizing commercially available sensors and controllers, enables real-time on-site measurements of crucial parameters like water turbidity, acidity (pH), and temperature. Calibration and validation studies, conducted in the laboratory using calibration samples and UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy, ensure the accuracy and reliability of the measurements, bolstering confidence in its effectiveness. Testing in an artificial lake, alongside comparisons with untreated wastewater samples, demonstrates its practical utility. Moreover, its potential for miniaturization and portability facilitates easy deployment for on-site environmental monitoring, promising significant contributions to environmental assessment and management efforts.

###### This is a project which uses 4 sensors namely, TDS sensor, turbidity sensor, pH sensor,
